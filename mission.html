<h3>Here's what we know.</h3>

<p>
Clues:</strong> Our best lead is the following photo sent to us by an anonymous source, which appears to show the target. Computer image enhancement revealed the word "Carolina" on his shirt. We believe this to refer to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<strong>Task: </strong> Your first task is to fly to Chapel Hill, NC to meet with university administrators and learn about the target's history in the area, if any. This should get us valuable information needed to continue the investigation.
