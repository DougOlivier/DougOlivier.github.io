  <strong>Target:</strong> Our intelligence agents have identified a person of interest - a young male who goes by the name of Doug Olivier. Whether or not that is a pseudonym is unknown at this time.  Little is known about the target, but there is buzz throughout the industry that he is tremendously skilled. We have reason to believe that he would be of great value to the organization.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Mission:</strong> Your mission is to investigate the target, learn his background and abilities, identify his current location, and confront him with an offer of employment. This is of utmost importance, so we implore you to get started immediately.
